# 🎲 Advice Generator App

This project is part of **Milestone 3 - Application Process**, where I completed a case study and presented it in a mock technical interview. The goal was to demonstrate my ability to work with **third-party APIs** and explain my solution effectively.

## 🔹 Overview

The Advice Generator App dynamically fetches and displays random advice using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/). Clicking the dice button retrieves a new piece of advice in real time.

### 🏆 Challenge

This project is based on the **Frontend Mentor** challenge:  
🔗 [Advice Generator App Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db)

- Fetches and displays random advice from an API.
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop.
- Interactive dice button with hover effects.
