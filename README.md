# Advice Generator App

This project is part of **Milestone 3 - Application Process**, where I complete a case study and present it in a mock technical interview. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to work with **third-party APIs** and explain my solution effectively.

## 🔹 Overview

This app generates random advice using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/). Clicking the dice button fetches a new piece of advice dynamically. 

### ✅ Features
- Fetches and displays random advice.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- Interactive dice button with hover effects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** - Structured content.
- **CSS** - Responsive styling with Flexbox & Grid.
- **JavaScript** - Fetch API for data handling.
